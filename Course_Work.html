The class was primarily focused on traditional archival practices. I used this paper to connect traditional archival practices of description with current social media technologies that also utilize ideas of repositories and description of content. This paper touches on my interest of humans’ interactions with technology with a comparison to archival description.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The entire paper can be found here:</p></div>

This was a highly collaborative project from the course User Experience Design taken in Spring 2018. I served as the client partner and was the key communicator with our client. Together, we frequently video chatted and used Google Documents to create experience maps and interview questions. Ulysses and I completed the card sort of the initial survey. The team collaborated for the final recommendations and the remainder of the report.</p><p>The entire paper can be found here:&nbsp;</p></div>
